### Briefly About Myself:

My interest in the world of IT began to develop from the moment of admission in university. <br>
I started learning Figma, HTML + CSS, C++ at the same time. But I got the most pleasure from Figma and HTML, therefore I decided to become more interested in this area, because C++ didn't bring me such joy from the result of work.

### Code Example:

*My personal code from my univesity labs.* There is JS method for simple calculator, nothing difficult. Here code will be without HTML structure. I have many more codes, but decided to use this one.

```javascript
let display = document.getElementById("display");

   function plus (x) {
        display.value += x;
    }

   function minus (x)  {
        display.value += x;
    }
    function times (x) {
        display.value += x;
    }
    function divide (x) {
        display.value += x;
    }
    function sum (x) {
        display.value = eval(display.value); // i decided use eval here, because in this case eval is not devil, and when we create Simple calculator eval more convinient as I guess
    }
```
